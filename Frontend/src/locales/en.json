    "description1": "This PhotoWalk leads you straight through the green heart of Hamburg. This park was opened in 1914 and is for most people living in Hamburg the best place for a barbecue with friends or a nice sunday walk. This PhotoWalk guides you along some of the 23 artworks displayed in the park. Can you use these statues to master our Photochallenges? Apart from the statues you will pass one of Hamburg’s most famous buildings: the 1930 rebuilt water tower, today known as the city's planetarium. This walk begins and ends near Hamburg’s subway stations. We recommend starting from the Saarlandstraße subway station and finish the walk near Borgweg subway station.",
    "description2": "Even though being Hamburg’s newest district the Hafencity holds a lot of tradition and history. On this PhotoWalk you will see the many facets which make Hamburg in our opinion the most beautiful city in the north: the proximity to the water, the fresh breeze which is even welcome in Hamburg’s renowned Schietwetter, the UNESCO world heritage the Speicherstadt, as well as a lot of innovative and modern architecture with lots of glas. \nLet the PhotoWalk lead you from the Elbbrücken to the Elbphilharmonie. Try going on this walk once a month and be surprised by the growth and change of this district. Maybe you can even capture the evolution of a new part of the Hafencity with your photos.",
    "description3": "This short PhotoWalk takes you around the Binnenalster in the downtown area of Hamburg. The Binnenalster has an area of nearly 18 hectare and is the smaller and southern part of the Alster lake. The white facades and copper-covered roofs of the surrounding buildings present an unique panorama. You can take some great shots from here, especially in the early evening hours. Not without reason is the area around the Binnenalster called “Gute Stube Hamburgs”. Why don’t you try doing this PhotoWalk a couple of times during different times of day and see if you can solve the challenges in different ways! This PhotoWalk leads you right to the entrance to the most famous park in Hamburg. If you haven't had enough after this PhotoWalk you can keep going and continue exploring Planten un Blomen.",

If you just want to get going, press the “START A PHOTOWALK” button or orient yourself by looking at the navigation by pressing the menu button on the top left. This menu can take you directly to all pages of the PhotoWalk site. On the “All PhotoWalks” page you can choose one of three PhotoWalks. The “My Photos” page shows all of your uploaded photos as well as all photos your friends uploaded. You can see and manage your friends on PhotoWalk on the “My Friends” page. If you would like to change your username, your profile picture, or your password you can do so on the “Settings” page. You can even delete your account there if you don’t want to use PhotoWalk anymore.",
    "step2":"If you click on the “START A PHOTOWALK” Button here or use the navigation to go to the “All PhotoWalks” site, you will see this page with an overview of all PhotoWalks. You can choose one of these three PhotoWalks by simply clicking on the respective map. If you have already uploaded something to a PhotoWalk it will be displayed with a pink colour. PhotoWalks you haven’t done yet are displayed grey.",
    "step3":"After choosing a PhotoWalk you will get a more detailed description of it. Here you’ll see the exact route on the map as well as a list of our challenges for this PhotoWalk. When you have arrived at the actual location and are ready to start the walk you can press “START WALK”. The map will then show your current location while you’re taking the walk.",
    "step4":"Farther down on the same page you can upload the photos you took for the challenges. That way you can share your photos with your friends. You can do the challenges right where it’s marked on the map or on the way between the markers. How you do the PhotoWalk and where you start it is totally up to you. We want you to have the most fun while doing our PhotoWalks.",
    "step5":"Going on a PhotoWalk together is the most fun. So even though you are walking alone with your camera, you can share your pictures on PhotoWalk. On the “My Friends” page you can find other users by their username and add them to your friends list. Ask a person in your friend group what their username is and search for them in the provided field. When you find them, you can send them a friend request which they can accept. And just like that you two are friends and can share your PhotoWalk results with each other.",
    "step6":"On the “My Photos” page you can have a look at all photos that you have uploaded. Also, you’ll see all photos of your friends. If you like a picture a lot, you can show it to your friends by clicking on the heart icon. This way you can motivate each other to take even more amazing pictures."
